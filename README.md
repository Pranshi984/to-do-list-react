# to-do-list-react

In this project, we will create a Todolist app using React. The app will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks. It will also have a feature to mark tasks as completed and filter tasks by status. Additionally, we will focus on implementing a clean and user-friendly design using CSS.

Approach:
To build this application, we will be using the following tools and technologies:

React - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Hooks - A feature that allows functional components to use state and lifecycle methods.
CSS - To style the app and make it visually appealing.
We will start by setting up the React environment and creating the necessary components for the app. We will then focus on building the UI and styling the app using CSS. After that, we will implement the logic for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks. Finally, we will test the app thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.

Features:
The app will have the following features:

Add Task - Users will be able to add a task to the list by entering the task name and clicking the "Add" button.
Edit Task - Users will be able to edit a task by clicking on the task name and updating it.
Delete Task - Users will be able to delete a task by clicking on the delete button next to the task.
Complete Task - Users will be able to mark a task as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to the task name.
Filter Tasks - Users will be able to filter tasks by status (completed or incomplete).
